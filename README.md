# Pig-Game
A simple pig game. The aim of the game is to reach 100 points before the other player. 

This was a teacher-led project as part of 'The Compelte Javascript Course 2021'.

The game used 'Active' player roles to control the functionality of each players buttons. As well as manipulating CSS through functions.
